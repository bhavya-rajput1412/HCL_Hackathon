 Project Summary
This project implements a real-world retail loyalty data pipeline that reads transactional customer data from a CSV file, validates it, stores it in a database, awards loyalty points, calculates RFM metrics, segments customers, identifies unknown customers, and visualizes insights to support marketing and retention strategies.

 Objectives
 Ensure clean, validated, structured data
  Reward customers using loyalty rules
  Measure customer value mathematically
  Identify churn-risk customers
  Separate unknown vs known customers
  Provide business-ready insights via analytics

Database Tables Created
Table Name
Description
transactions
Valid clean transactions
rejected_records
Invalid records + error reason
customer_details
Customer profile + loyalty balance
loyalty_transactions
Points earned per transaction
rfm_metrics
RFM values for each customer

 Segmentation Logic
Segment
Condition
High-Spender
Monetary >= 90th percentile
At-Risk
Recency > 30 days AND total_points > 0
Regular
Everyone else


 Visualization Output
Created charts include:
Donut chart (segment distribution)


RFM correlation heatmap


Monetary vs Recency scatter plot


Frequency vs Monetary bubble chart


Boxplots for Recency, Frequency, Monetary


Points vs Monetary regression analysis


These help understand customer behavior patterns and marketing actions.
